# Python - Serialization

This project introduces marshaling and serialization concepts through practical
Python tasks. It focuses on converting Python objects to transferable/storable
formats (e.g., JSON) and rebuilding the original objects from those formats.

## Learning Goals

- Understand serialization and how it differs from marshaling
- Serialize Python data structures to files for persistence
- Deserialize stored data back into Python objects
- Recognize common formats (JSON, XML, binary) and their trade-offs

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Executable scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Follow `pycodestyle` conventions
- Use context managers (`with`) for file handling

## Repository

- **GitHub repository:** `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming`
- **Directory:** `python-serialization`
